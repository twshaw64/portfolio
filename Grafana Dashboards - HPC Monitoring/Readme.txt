During this project at a previous employer, I created a multitude of dashboards. The focus being a set of monthly cluster report dashboards. 
These showed any useful metric that we could track in a meaningful way, the main focus being CPU/GPU/Mem/Disk usage, as well as temperatures and per user usage statistics.
They also incorporated a report generator, which would create neatly formatted reports from the dashboard content.

These are the only screenshots I have available to me, and include some side projects:
A current status dashboard, for an 'at-a-glance' assessment of a cluster's health.
A utilisation dashboard, showing the job status and CPU/Mem usage of all nodes in a cluster, both currently and over time.
