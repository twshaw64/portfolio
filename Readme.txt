Welcome to my portfolio.

In this repository, you will find a number of my previous projects that highlight some of my various skills and areas of expertise.
Each project contains its own readme, to give a brief overview of what it entails.
I encourage you to have a look at the reports provided in some of the projects, which go into detail regarding the goals, challenges and achievements of these projects.

Please note that my previous position required the use of an internal github account. As such, none of that work is public, or reflected in my commit history.
